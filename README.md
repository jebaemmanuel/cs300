# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course, I analyzed and used the right data structure to solve a problem. The analysis included understanding the complexities of different algorithms used with the corresponding data structures. 
# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem but understanding the read and write patterns of the problem, and then identifying the right data structure to use. Data structures are important because using the wrong data structure could cause the solution to be unacceptably expensive. 
# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
When a roadblock occured I read either the documentation or searched on search engines to find a solution.
# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Understanding of different data structures improves the arsenal of tools at your disposal.
# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Repeated learning of data structures has meant that I am now fluent in more algorithms. Also structuring code the right way can make it easy to understand and need less actual code.
